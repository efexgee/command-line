Life on the Command Line
## Notes for an unfinished informal presentation on how to work in a Linux command line environment.
The target audience for this is scientists and statisticians with little or no command line experience. The final presentation would have included a skeleton bash script containing examples of some of the most useful code snippets. E.g. loops, argument checking, STDERR output, etc.
